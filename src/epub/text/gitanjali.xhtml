			<p>Thou hast made me endless, such is thy pleasure. This frail vessel thou emptiest again and again, and fillest it ever with fresh life.</p>
			<p>This little flute of a reed thou hast carried over hills and dales, and hast breathed through it melodies eternally new.</p>
			<p>At the immortal touch of thy hands my little heart loses its limits in joy and gives birth to utterance ineffable.</p>
			<p>Thy infinite gifts come to me only on these very small hands of mine. Ages pass, and still thou pourest, and still there is room to fill.</p>

			<p>When thou commandest me to sing it seems that my heart would break with pride; and I look to thy face, and tears come to my eyes.</p>
			<p>All that is harsh and dissonant in my life melts into one sweet harmony⁠—and my adoration spreads wings like a glad bird on its flight across the sea.</p>
			<p>I know thou takest pleasure in my singing. I know that only as a singer I come before thy presence.</p>
			<p>I touch by the edge of the far-spreading wing of my song thy feet which I could never aspire to reach.</p>
			<p>Drunk with the joy of singing I forget myself and call thee friend who art my lord.</p>

			<p>The light of thy music illumines the world. The life breath of thy music runs from sky to sky. The holy stream of thy music breaks through all stony obstacles and rushes on.</p>
			<p>My heart longs to join in thy song, but vainly struggles for a voice. I would speak, but speech breaks not into song, and I cry out baffled. Ah, thou hast made my heart captive in the endless meshes of thy music, my master!</p>

			<p>Where dost thou stand behind them all, my lover, hiding thyself in the shadows? They push thee and pass thee by on the dusty road, taking thee for naught. I wait here weary hours spreading my offerings for thee, while passersby come and take my flowers, one by one, and my basket is nearly empty.</p>
			<p>The morning time is past, and the noon. In the shade of evening my eyes are drowsy with sleep. Men going home glance at me and smile and fill me with shame. I sit like a beggar maid, drawing my skirt over my face, and when they ask me, what it is I want, I drop my eyes and answer them not.</p>
			<p>Oh, how, indeed, could I tell them that for thee I wait, and that thou hast promised to come. How could I utter for shame that I keep for my dowry this poverty. Ah, I hug this pride in the secret of my heart.</p>
			<p>I sit on the grass and gaze upon the sky and dream of the sudden splendour of thy coming⁠—all the lights ablaze, golden pennons flying over thy car, and they at the roadside standing agape, when they see thee come down from thy seat to raise me from the dust, and set at thy side this ragged beggar girl a-tremble with shame and pride, like a creeper in a summer breeze.</p>
			<p>But time glides on and still no sound of the wheels of thy chariot. Many a procession passes by with noise and shouts and glamour of glory. Is it only thou who wouldst stand in the shadow silent and behind them all? And only I who would wait and weep and wear out my heart in vain longing?</p>

			<p>Early in the day it was whispered that we should sail in a boat, only thou and I, and never a soul in the world would know of this our pilgrimage to no country and to no end.</p>

			<p>We sang no glad songs nor played; we went not to the village for barter; we spoke not a word nor smiled; we lingered not on the way. We quickened our pace more and more as the time sped by.</p>

			<p>My companions laughed at me in scorn; they held their heads high and hurried on; they never looked back nor rested; they vanished in the distant blue haze. They crossed many meadows and hills, and passed through strange, faraway countries. All honour to you, heroic host of the interminable path! Mockery and reproach pricked me to rise, but found no response in me. I gave myself up for lost in the depth of a glad humiliation⁠—in the shadow of a dim delight.</p>

			<p>The great pageant of thee and me has overspread the sky. With the tune of thee and me all the air is vibrant, and all ages pass with the hiding and seeking of thee and me.</p>
